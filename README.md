# Automatically mute Spotify Ads

I hate listening to Spotify Ads. This small script detects when Ads gets loaded and lowers the system audio way down until a song it's loaded again.

# How to automate the 4 steps two clicks

1. Download the `AdsBlockShortcut.sh`
2. Opep your `termial App`
3. Create a folder and move the script here. (Example: a folder named `Spotify-AdsBlocker` in `Downloads folder`
4. In your terminal type ` cd /Users/sajjadsalaria/Downloads/Spotify-AdsBlocker`
5. While in the folder, Run this command `chmod +x AdsBlockShortcut.sh`. This will grant permission to the script to run.
6. On opening script for first time you will be show a dialog box `Click Yes`
7. Vola! Now your `Two Click Spotify Ad Blocker` is ready to rock and roll.

## Steps to show Desktop Notification script

1. Open AdsBlockShortcut.sh
2. Uncomment line number 5

This is how it is in the file with # symbol `# sh ~/MuteSpotifyAds/NoAdsSpotify.sh show`

Remove the `#` symbol and now desktop notifications are enabled.

# Bonus

- There's also a mac App in root directory named `NoAdsSpotify` which makes the whole process easy & visual for beginners.
